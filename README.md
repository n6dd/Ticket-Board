 2. Successful login

 If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued, stored in localStorage, and youâ€™re redirected to the Kanban board.

 3. Failed login

 If the credentials are invalid, an error message is displayed.

 4. Protected Kanban board

 The board is only accessible with a valid JWT.

 If unauthenticated, you will be redirected to the login page.

 5. Session timeout

 After a period of inactivity, the JWT expires.

 The next action will redirect you to the login page.

 6. Logout 

 Clears the JWT from localStorage and redirects to the login page.
